## 📁 Project Structure

```
Simple-vocab/
├── app.py                 # Main Flask application (all routes + templates)
├── vocabs.txt             # JSON file containing lessons & vocabulary ⭐
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies (flask)
├── README.md             # This file

## 📦 vocabs.txt Format

The app loads vocabulary from a `vocabs.txt` file containing **valid JSON**. Here's the expected structure:

```json
[
  {
    "lesson_name": "Lesson 1: Basic Greetings",
    "words": [
      {
        "spanish": "hola",
        "czech": "ahoj",
        "type": "Phrase",
        "notes": "Informal greeting"
      },
      {
        "spanish": "gracias",
        "czech": "děkuji",
        "type": "Phrase",
        "notes": "Polite thank you"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "lesson_name": "Lesson 2: Common Nouns",
    "words": [
      {
        "spanish": "casa",
        "czech": "dům",
        "type": "Noun",
        "notes": "Feminine in Spanish"
      },
      {
        "spanish": "perro",
        "czech": "pes",
        "type": "Noun",
        "notes": "Masculine"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Word Object Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `spanish` | string | ✅ | The Spanish word/phrase |
| `czech` | string | ✅ | The Czech translation |
| `type` | string | ❌ | Category: `Noun`, `Verb`, `Adjective`, `Phrase` (used for colored badges) |
| `notes` | string | ❌ | Additional context, grammar notes, or usage tips |

> ⚠️ **Important**: Save the file as `vocabs.txt` with **UTF-8 encoding** to support special characters (ñ, č, ř, etc.)
